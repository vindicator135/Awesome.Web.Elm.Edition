Mukhang sinigang sir ah...' The man looked at me and smiled faintly. We talked for a bit while waiting for our buses.  I learned that he came here some years ago, he couldn't recall the exact number, and he was a successful engineer back home. He was really excited telling me about his past career, position and memories from before here, while asking me about what the familiar places he used to go in the Philippines. He sounded excited about the Philippines and knowing I just recently arrived. Then, I asked him how he is now and where he works. His face changed and from him I saw someone who has never looked so defeated in life. He said he's doing odd jobs whenever he finds one. At the moment, he really wants to get employed as a construction worker, which even that, he said is very difficult with all the competition and all his disadvantage against younger people and other nationalities. He's on his way home to cook lunch for the kids because his wife is at work and he didn't find a gig for that day."
